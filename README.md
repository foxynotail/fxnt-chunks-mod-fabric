# FXNT Chunks
A simple Chunk Loading mod that allows (OP) players to select chunks to force load or force tick using a Chunk Wand item.

## On Servers:

- Force Loaded chunks will remain loaded when the player isn't online
- Force Ticking chunks will remain loaded and be randomly ticked when the player isn't online

## On Single Player

- Force Loaded chunks will remain loaded when outside of the player's simulation distance
- Force Ticking chunks will remain loaded and be randomly ticked when outside of the player's simulation distance
